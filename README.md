BRRR is an experiment, to attempt to tie a monetary policy to inversely match a peg and provide accrued interest from that movement of that peg. 
As such, since our peg is the US dollar supply in USDT,
<blockquote>
 BRRR is not an acronym, but an interjection resounding from the sound of U.S Federal Reserve printing press.

</blockquote>
As our foundation relies on the money printer going BRRR, we have taken it as our core definition. BRRR is a nation, founded by the founding fathers. BRRR users are patriots, fighting for the cause of financial independence. BRRR is a monetary policy fighting against the tyranny of injustice and financial pervertedness. </h1>

<blockquote align="right" >

## Interest Bearing Deposits. Continuously rebased supply to find price stability. Advanced Bonding Curve to drive price exploration.

See the protocol documentation here: https://docs.brrr.fi 

BRRR, BRRR3X and BRRR10X is an experimental protocol building upon the most advanced innovations in programmable money and DeFi. Built by a team of passionate patriots, BRRR combines memes and building a nation to provide financial freedom to our citizens.
BRRR, BRRR3X, and BRRR10X are built to achieve:


*  an inversely proportional supply pegged to USDT to seek eventual price stability.

*   a treasury reserve to further support stability and provide swaps.

*  Smart contracts with fail switches in the event of any catastrophic bug so no deposited funds can even be lost.

*   Continuous rebasing of the treasury reserves to drive price stability.

*   Mechanisms that incentivizes participation and reward good behavior.

BRRR, BRRR3X and BRRR10X are dynamic supply cryptocurrencies which expands and contracts its supply in response to USDT's balance sheets, initially set to 10x the total supply of USDT, everytime USDT mints, or burns USDT, the exact same amount is inversely created or burnt on BRRR. (BRRR3x and 10x multiply the amount by their respective values to create higher risk higher reward exposures). This stability mechanism includes one key addition to existing elastic supply models such as Ampleforth: a continuously rebased total supply that rewards the rebaser for updating the supply. As soon as tether mints or burns, BRRR should be updated - as the mechanism allows for high level of financial rewards for doing so. Providing real time continuous rebases as USDT changes.

# BRRR.fi smart contracts and protocol. 

## Audits

None. The developers have done their best to ensure the security of these contracts, which have been tested on testnet, but make no guarantees. There is a possibility - that there are bugs. Because of that, we have included emergency security protocols to ensure all deposits are safe and can be accessed, never lost. See below. 
```diff
! The code is public and can be reviewed, --should be reviewed--, by you before using this experimental protocol. 
```


## Security Protocols - Emergency Withdrawals and disabling

In the event of a major bug there are a series of functions defined to 
```
1. Disabled all deposits
2. Allow every user to withdrawal their deposits, without needing to pay/deposit BRRR back. 
```

Meaning at any point if there is a security issue, the contract can be turned off, and all deposits can be withdrawal by the depositer in full. 

No funds can be lost in the contract in the event of a bug. We hope. The code is public and can be reviewed, <b>should be reviewed,</b> by you before using this experimental protocol. 

Only the admin can activate the Emergency functions to disable all future deposits and if the contract is offline, all deposits are automatically able to be withdrawal by the person who deposited them. See the code in this repo, or the docs below for those functions. 

## Continuous Rebases
Rebases are initiated by any user called the `brrrEvent()` function. If the block timestamp of the last supply check is not the current block timestamp, then it will fetch the totalSupply of USDT from Tether's contracts. 

If the totalSupply is different from the last supply check, it will process the difference and reward the rebaser for updating the state with 1/1000th of the difference in supply. 

If there is a difference, the total supply and the block time is stored in the supply_checks history for future checks. 

The difference is burned/minted depending on what USDT did, if it minted 3% of its total USDT, BRRR burns 3% of its total BRRR. And .00003% BRRR goes to the rebaser. Visa verse for USDT burns.

## Peg Formula 

BRRR Supply Formula

**1 General Formula**

When an BRRREvent happens (Tether prints more USDT, or burns, but we all know they never burn any USDT), the treasury reserve reduces or increases its supply based off the amount  that was changed. 
BRRR3X and BRRR10X do this 3x and 10x more, effectively providing much more exposure to the inverse peg of USDT. 
The following formula dictates the total supply of BRRR tokens that exist in the Treasury Reserve at any given time:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-MEQHcVFL9xf9FdJXjvF%2F-MF0g8vQfFhy35aD5pWs%2F-MF0gIZHMbh89C_awZkM%2F5206c96846175fdb74891cd2a42f3ecb.png?alt=media&token=85ca9e4f-86ee-4f46-a2d6-a6a41cdecb3e" />
</p>
Now since the BRRR protocol offers leverage tokens, we might be tempted to understand the supply of BRRR3x and BRRR10x. The general formula for those can be derived from (1):

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-MEQHcVFL9xf9FdJXjvF%2F-MF0g8vQfFhy35aD5pWs%2F-MF0gLWdoPa3USInI4Gy%2Fa57d140575a85ec5563f650c01f95916.png?alt=media&token=f7d0c878-b14a-41e8-a28c-db41b7fc1d7e" />
</p>

**New Formulas**
The problem with formula (2) is that we are multiplying very large numbers, which might pose a problem in terms of computation in the smart contract. In light of this, we are proposing a new formula that is the same as the original. It uses a logarithmic transformation of (2) as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-MEQHcVFL9xf9FdJXjvF%2F-MF0g8vQfFhy35aD5pWs%2F-MF0gOBhMNq4A2v642c_%2F0f266f2765cd2c5f59c2a1dff02c8948.png?alt=media&token=fe34fcb0-bec1-4a49-a80d-4af9bbb3953b" />
